# Arknights: Endfield Simple Modeler

A lightweight **Windows Forms tool** for tracking and managing production lines in *Arknights: Endfield*.  
Built quickly to help visualize big production setups and keep things organized.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- This is an early version: not all items or icons are implemented.  
- Bugs or missing features may appear.  
- Created in just a few hours for personal use, shared here in case it helps someone else.  
- The workspace **does not save**, since only one production line is shown at a time.  
- I don’t know when or if I will update this, but at least it exists
